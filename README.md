# üìù About the Bot

This Bot aims to provide a virtual TODO list inside your discord server. Instead of relying on commands for interacting with the bot, I tried my best to make the entire "user interface" with reactions. That way your users dont have to learn hundrets of new commands and how to use them.

<br>

# üé¨ Getting Started

After inviting the Bot to your server, run the command `/settings set todochannel: #yourchannel`. This generates a new config and saves your todochannel. Your TODOS or tasks will then be posted in that channel.

# üñ•Ô∏è Commands

To view all the commands the bot supports, run the `/help` command. If you want to get more specific information about a command run the command `/help` with the command that you want information about as frist argument. So if you wanted to get information about the todo command, you would want to run the command like so: `/help todo`.

**Available Commands:**

# Some Additional Information

## Readonly Setting

If you set a readonly channel, you can from now on use the `share` reaction ![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/724022854231916684/844963684501684234/unknown.png) to share the todo to the channel that you configured. All changes to that TODO will be mirrored to that channel, so if someone finishes a task, edits the todo or closes it, everything will be shown in the read only channel.

## User/Staff Roles

These roles are used to determine permissions. "USERs" are users that can interact with the bot. People with the "STAFF" role are users that can change and edit bot settings and force assing users. Having the discord permission `MANAGE GUILD` will override this permission system and allow you to edit the bots settings.

## Autopurge

If you enable this setting, all messages that are sent in your configured todo channel and are not from the bot or a user without the `STAFF` role will be deleted. This is useful if you want to use your todochannel for tasks only and keep the chatting in other channels.

## Todomode

As you may have seen, there are 2 choices for this: `simple` and `advanced`:

**Simple**

> In this mode all "todo activity" will happen in the preconfigured TODO channel. Means if you run the todo command in lets say the `general` channel, your todo will pop up in the configured todo channel (lets call it `tasks`).

**Advanced**

> In this mode, the todos will be created in the channel, where the todo command is run in. So lets say you run the todo command in the `general` channel, the todo will pop up in this very `general` channel.

# Images & Attachments
If you want to attach an image to your task, you can simply upload an image and give it a title like so: {{thisismytitle}} ("thisismytitle" will then be the title to reference). 


When creating your task then reference the image with your title in the image options. The image will then be embedded into your todo list. **Note:** The image will be available 24hrs after uploading (for every guild member). This is due to the bot caching the links to images that are uploaded with the special tags (the double curly brackets {{}}).


For attaching normal links, just put them in the url option, if will then be shown as attachment in your todo list.

# üîê Permissions

There are 2 permission levels: `USER` and `STAFF`. They are determined by roles.

To set the role, use the settings command like so:

(yes multiple roles are allowed)

![permissions demo](https://github.com/shitcorp/TODOBOT/raw/main/assets/gifs/permissions.gif)

To remove a role from the user of staffroles array just use the `/settings remove userrole: | staffrole:` command

<br>

# ‚å®Ô∏è Custom Commands / Tags

Tags are a way to essentially build your own custom commands. Let the bot learn new tags by using the `/tag learn` command.

Delete a custom command by using the `/tag unlearn` command followed by the name of your tag.

<br>

## **Placeholders**

<details>
<summary>Click here to read about placeholders in custom commands</summary>

Placeholders are words that you can place inside your tags, that will be replaced with a certain value, when the custom command is run.

Available Placeholders:

```diff
+ <MEMCOUNT> => Will be rpelaced with the membercount of the current guild
+ <JOIN_POS> => Will be replaced by the join position of the message author
+ <EMBED> => Will generate an embed with your tag message. Optional Parameters are <COLOR> BLUE </COLOR>, (make sure to include a space after the color tags) <IMG> img.todo-bot.xyz/bliDnJn </IMG>, <THUMB> img.todo-bot.xyz/bZLhbHl </THUMB>
+ <PROCESSED> => Will be replaced with the amount of processed tasks by the message author
+ <SUBMITTED> => Will be replaced with the amount of submitted tasks by the message author
+ <MSG_AUTHOR> => Will tag the message author
+ <MSG_AUTHOR_ID> => Will be replaced with the message author id
+ <MSG_AUTHOR_NAME> => Will be replaced with the message authors username, so in my case "MeerBiene"
+ <MSG_AUTHOR_TAG> => Will be replaced with the message authors tag, so in my case "MeerBiene#7060"
+ <GUILD_NAME> => Will be replaced with the guilds name where the message was sent
```

**Notes:**

- All placeholders are ignorecase, so you can use them like `<join_pos>` or `<guild_name>`

- You can combine all the placeholders, so you can use the `<guild_name>` placeholder within an embed

</details>

<br>

## **Variables**

<details>
<summary>Click here to read about variables in custom commands</summary>

Variables are a way to store key-value pairs for your guild/server, so you can use them in your tags. This is useful if you have a discord for lets say a game server where the ip could change. To follow our example, we would create a variable called `ip` and store the ip adress:

# üîî Reminders

![reminder command demo](https://github.com/shitcorp/TODOBOT/raw/main/assets/gifs/reminder_cmd_demo.gif)

Note:

- **The lowest possible time is 1m (1 Minute)!**

## **Mentions**

If you want to mention certain users or roles when the reminder finished, just mention them in the reminders content when creating a new reminder.

## **Repeating reminders**

For repeating reminders, simply set the `loop` property to true when creating the reminder. **Keep in mind that the lowest possible time for repeating reminders is 1 hour!**
